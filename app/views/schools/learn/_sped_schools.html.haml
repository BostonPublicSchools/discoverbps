#sped_schools_list.schools_list.hidden
  .note.small
    This list includes your home-based choices, as well as those schools in a larger community cluster that offer SPED programs. When you register for school, your choice list will include only home-based options. Your childâ€™s IEP, which will be reviewed after registration by special education staff members, will determine if any of these schools may be presented to you as an option. For more information, call 617-635-8599.
