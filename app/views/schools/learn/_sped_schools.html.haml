    The schools below have program offerings for special education needs.
    These schools are drawn from a larger community cluster than the schools on your home-based list.
    When you register for school, your choice list will include only home-based options.
    After you register, your childâ€™s IEP will be reviewed by special education staff members who will determine if any of the schools on this list may be presented to you as an option.
