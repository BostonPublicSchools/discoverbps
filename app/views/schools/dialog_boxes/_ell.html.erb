			<p class='first'>As part of the registration process, every applicant is asked to complete a Home Language Survey. The results of this Survey determine whether a child needs additional language assessment at our Newcomers Assessment and Counseling Center. Results of the language assessment will indicate if a child should receive additional language learning support in school. If this is the case, a child's school choices may expand beyond his/her Home Based options to include program seats in a wider community cluster of schools. Click here to view a map of the ELL Clusters. Note, your cluster is based on your place of residence.  You may still use this tool to learn about your Home Based school options.</p>
			<p>For more information on clusters, the Language Assessment, or the Newcomer's Assessment and Counseling Center, please call a Welcome Center near you or contact the Newcomers Center directly at:</p>
